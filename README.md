# Dashboard_weather


## Getting Started
This is a homework for University of Oregon Bootcamp. It utilizes the use of openweather API and moments.js. 

## Objective

In this homework we are tasks to build a weather dashboard. The user can type in a location and it will display the weather today and the weather for the next 5 days. Be aware that the future weather are only displayed for the morning weather.

## Issues 

While building the weather dashboard, the issues I have encountered are using the API, for some reason the code onyl works if I use const instead of var and double qoutes instead of single qoutes.

## Future Improvements

Given the time constraint, I am limited to what the user ticket asked. In the future I would like to add an animation using skycons to my weather icon.
